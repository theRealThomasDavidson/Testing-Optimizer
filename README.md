Just thinking about covid testing and proper use of resources. 


So, I (Thomas Davidson) was doing a little math in my free time to see
how much batch testing covid tests would reduce cost, time, and materials.
I was surprised when I figured about optimized performance and found that
there was a lot more savings than I expected. 

So, initially on july 24 to 31 I would like to have memory reserved to 
detect based on current samples how many samples should be an a batch test. 

moving forward I would love to be able to give running totals and to move 
items from memory to storage. august 1 - 4

Lastly I would like to rework my initial math accounting for false 
positives and false negatives.
